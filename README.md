# Angular6Project - Manage Employee

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.9.

A web application to view, create, edit and delete employee details. Built with Angular version 6. The application covers CRUD operations and uses a fake json data store for database - "db.json" file.

## To Setup the Json server

1. Navigate to project root folder. 
2. Install json server in local workspace using the command: `npm install -g json-server`
3. Start the json server using the command: `json-server --watch db.json`. The "db.json" refers to the json data file.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
